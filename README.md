## Overview
This is an academic project with fictional data and it was developed under the scope of Machine Learning curricular unit at NOVA IMS.

## Business Understanding
LaGoste Stores is a company that operates in the fashion, sports and luxury sectors. Their products offer consists in five categories: Sneakers, Rackets, T-Shirts, Watches and Hats, each one divided in Premium Brand and Mainstream Articles.

In spite of having solid revenues and a healthy bottom line for the past five years, the company's profit growth perspectives for the next two years are not optimistic. In order to change those perspectives the company is outlining some strategic initiatives.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
